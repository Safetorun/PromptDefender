## api

This package includes the open API file and another called openai.yml.tpl. This is a template file
that is used to generate the openapi.yml file and is generated by terraform. This is done by the
makefile in the root directory of the project. The openapi.yml file is used by the swagger UI to
generate the documentation. The openapi.yml file is also used by the go-swagger library to generate
the server stubs and client stubs.


## cmd

The commands are each a deployed function. Specifically, they are the entry point for the lambda
function. Each command has a main.go file that is the entry point for the lambda function.
