To build your keep, we will use the prompt defender app application. Head over to the app and create an account if
you haven't already.

Once you have created an account, you will be presented with a prompt screen, take your existing prompt and paste it
into the prompt box. You will then be presented with a screen like this:

Click 'Harden prompt' and you will see a new prompt appear in the box above which has been hardened to protect against
injection attacks.

That's really it! Paste that prompt into your application and replace your existing prompt. Make sure you read through 
and understand the prompt before you do this, as it is important to understand what is happening. Test thoroughly, and
enjoy the peace of mind that comes with knowing your application has taken the first step to protect against injection 
attacks.
