# Start by building your prompt defence

The first step in building out your Prompt Defence is to build your 'keep' - your keep involves changing the prompt
itself to give a clue to your LLM about how to use it safely.

Take your existing prompt and pass it as the 'prompt' into the keep endpoint.

We also recommend randomising your tag.

parameter.

# Finish it up with a Drawbridge (Coming soon)
